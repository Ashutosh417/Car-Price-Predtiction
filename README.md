## Predicting Car Prices Using an Artificial Neural Network.
- 6 Input layers.
- 4 Hidden layers using ReLU as activation function (64 neurons in first,32 in second,16 in third and 8 in fourth).
- 1 Output later using Linear Activation with one neuron(Linear Regression).
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss Fucntion: Mean_Squared_Error
